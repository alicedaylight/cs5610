Assignment 5
- From server side services doing a lot of tuning
- All changes on server side services (from assignment 4) .. to call database
- server side is on mock folder of ming's code

- use cdn for text angular
- mongodb one of non-relational databse
- embedded
- document based db
- instead of tables; called collections
         - need to define what should be inside this collection
         - need to have a schema (create a model)
         -

// define a user schema
// user schema requires schema server . js file

angular js provides $ .. not backend

we do not use angular in backend so backend always uses
- node.js
- express
- backends needs to talk to db.. need queue

-1. create schema (remember to pass mongoose)
-2. schema to create model
___Model.

can use mongoose api like create (CRUD operations)

app js connect model with services
app js needs to require model.services

model.services needs to return model?


when talking to db
- use promise q
var q = require("q");

function createWebsite(website) {
var deffered = q.defer()
// defer varaible will resolve you either theres an resolved, reject
    return websiteModel.create(webite);


need .then to handle promise calls

return deferred.promise
{


if use http do not need to use q

$http call is a defer call.. you call it you async you handle it

if use a timeout call (hits server every 5 seconds) you cannot use a .then
you have to turn that to a q


// to start the databse server type
